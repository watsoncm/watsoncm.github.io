I do math. And sometimes code. 

### More Information

I started my undergrad in 2017 primarily studying machine learning, then after a year and a half became disillusioned and made a complete about-face and focused entirely on math instead. I like to think this gives me a "unique perspective" on things, but in practice it just means I'm more pained whenever I see deep learning publications.

Current interests include algebraic geometry and number theory. In my off time I make meager attempts to practice cybersecurity, play with my dog, and write terrible poetry none of you should ever have to see.
