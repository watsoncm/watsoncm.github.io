There are a number of resources I've found incredibly useful in learning mathematics. I've collated some of them here:

Articles:
* [How to Read a Math Book](https://brownmath.com/stfa/read.htm). Reading math is very different than one might expect at first. To quote Von Neumann, "in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them." Sometimes it takes a few passes for things to sink in--the strategy and tips given here are very useful in encouraging that.

Books:
* [An Infinitely Large Napkin](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html). This project by Evan Chen is a remarkable introduction to some of my favorite topics in mathematics. It's a brilliant exposition aimed initially at students just starting to explore what undergraduate math migth be like that covers a remarkable swath of topics.
* [Linear Algebra Done Right](http://linear.axler.net/) by Sheldon Axler is an exceptional textbook for becoming comfortable with "formal" mathematics. It takes the unique approach of not discussing determinants until the end, with the immense payoff of emphasizing a intuitive, comfortable relationship with linear maps.

Videos:
* Of course, [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) has to be here. His videos contain some of the best expositions of mathematics I've ever seen, and they're highly accessible. They truly capture the wonder in mathematics.
* For a high-level understanding, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y) by Domain of Science is a good resource for mapping out mathematics. It definitely puts an unusual weight on some branches of mathematics over others, but for those looking for a general picture of some exciting fields, this is a great start.

Resources:
* The best resource you can find is another person. Find a study partner you can discuss ideas with as you read through a text or take a class together. If you can, find a mentor who has studied the topic you're trying to learn--many math students love helping students that were in their place a year ago, and are more than happy to give the kind of tips they've received on their way. While it's useful to struggle on problems, spending weeks stuck on conceptual blocks can be frustrating, and often it's better to clear things up with a mentor.
* In particular, students at many schools (mine included) have a tradition of creating a forum at the start of each course, i.e. a Messenger chat, to discuss problems and help each other out. This is an _exceptional_ model and has personally helped me learn mathematics and communicate it better too. If your school doesn't already do this, make a chat and share it with a few friends to discuss--the payoff is immense.
* [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/) is a resource that often flies under the radar at universities. Check your university library's webpage to see if your university has access--if so, SpringerLink provides PDFs of thousands of Springer textbooks for free.
* If you're really stumped, when all else fails, [Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/) is a question-and-answer website that can provide immense help. Reply times tend to be slow, so certainly rely on other resources as well.
* Twitter and certain Discord servers both have remarkable mathematics communities as well. Twitter is better for discussion (especially about category theory and algebraic geometry, for some reason!) whereas Discord channels like [this one](https://discord.sg/math) are more set up for Q&A.
