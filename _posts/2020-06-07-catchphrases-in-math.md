title: Catchphrases in math
---

One thing that I think is unique (or near-unique) to mathematics as a field is how difficult it is to roadmap. For instance, in computer science, most undergraduates can quickly get a rough idea of what deep learning, computer graphics, and programming language theory are by talking with someone about them. An expert in those fields can fairly readily convey the basic idea of, say, a neural network, or a raytracer, without too much strain. The details may be fairly complex, but the gist is readily accessible.

In mathematics, however, it can be a struggle to explain the rough idea behind a field. Concepts in mathematics tend to be stacked fairly vertically, making it sometimes hard to give simple, accessible descriptions. I've often had professors give me such explanations, only for them to make sense many months down the road. Giving students a taste of possible fields of study is important, but in general a hard pedagogical problem.

One professor I've had for several classes loves the idea of "catchphrases" in mathematics. Before delving into a new piece of machinery, she would often give a one-sentence description of what it did, i.e.

> The Fourier transform: converts differentiation with respect to \\(x\\) into multiplication by \\(\xi\\)

to remind us of how the Fourier transform was immediately useful in the context we were using it in (PDEs). Another example might be "Dirichlet characters: let us define useful analogs of the zeta function" or even "homology: lets us count n-dimensional holes in topological spaces." I found such up-front "big picture" statements incredibly useful in organizing math topics in my head, and honestly wish it were more common.

The closest I've found so far is Domain of Science's video [The Map of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y) and Quanta's identically named [The Map of Mathematics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-map-of-mathematics-20200213/), but the former confines all of algebra to a single point and the latter addresses an unusual scattering of topics. 

While I know anything I create will be just as irredemably skewed toward the topics I like, I can still hope unsuspecting freshmen happen upon it and become biased the same way I am. Hopefully more to come.
