title: Catchphrases in math
---

One thing that I think is unique (or near-unique) to mathematics as a field is how difficult it is to roadmap.

For instance, in computer science, most undergraduates can quickly get a rough idea of what deep learning, computer graphics, and programming language theory are by talking with someone about them. An expert in those fields can fairly readily convey the basic idea of, say, a neural network, or a raytracer, without too much strain. The details may be fairly complex, but the gist is readily accessible.

In mathematics, however, it can be a struggle to explain the rough idea behind a field. Concepts in mathematics tend to be stacked fairly vertically, making it sometimes hard to give simple, accessible descriptions. I've often had professors give me such explanations, only for them to make sense many months down the road. Giving students a taste of possible fields of study is important, but in general a hard pedagogical problem.

One professor I've had for several classes loves the idea of "catchphrases" in mathematics. Before delving into a new piece of machinery, she would often give a one-sentence description of what it did, i.e.

> The Fourier transform: converts differentiation with respect to \\(x\\) into multiplication by \\(\xi\\)

to remind us of how the Fourier transform was immediately useful in the context we were using it in (PDEs). Another example might be "Dirichlet characters: let us define useful analogs of the zeta function" or even "homology: lets us count n-dimensional holes in spaces." I found such up-front "big picture" statements incredibly useful in organizing math topics in my head, and honestly wish it were more common.

In the hope of being able to give other prospective undergraduate math students a top-down view of math, here are my tentative "catchphrase" approaches to different topics early undergraduates might face.
